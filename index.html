                                    <p class="text-muted"><strong>Siddharth Hathi</strong> is a student at Dartmouth College, and the former
                                        Chief Design Officer at Ghost Pacer inc. After joining Ghost Pacer as a software engineer in 2019, he
                                        overhauled their mobile application by building an all new UI/UX. He continued to work as one of the
                                        lead developers of the Ghost Pacer mobile app alongside his friend and coworker Izak Lewis. Over the coming
                                        months, he developed Ghost Pacer's websites, and created their successfully funded Kickstarter page.<br><br>
                                        Outside of Ghost Pacer, his engineering projects include a SpriteKit game for iOS, a website that
                                        allowed his peers at Lakeside High School to rate and review their classes, a virtual reality horror game, 
                                        and a rocket simulator built in Unity with real-time physics siumlation. Currently, he is building an
                                        iOS application designed to alleviate food waste in restaurants. Siddharth
                                        Hathi is also a photographer whose art is currently on display in Seattle city hall.

                            <p class="text-muted"> The Ghost Pacer mobile app has three main functionalities: it allows users to discover, store,
                                and upload running routes from Strava, it tracks and analyzes running data from the Ghost Pacer 
                                AR glasses using Firebase and custom analysis subroutines, and it interfaces with the Ghost Pacer 
                                glasses via Bluetooth LE so that users can send and receive data from the glasses. I developed the
                                entire UI and UX of the app and worked with Izak Lewis to build the app's functionality.

                                to appear near the top of related google searches and since the launch of our product it has directed
                                hundreds of customers to our Kickstarter who have cumulatively purchased thousands of dollars

                            <p class="text-muted"> In my senior year of high school we were given an extremely open-ended, 4-week
                                web developement project. Rather than building something that met the baseline requirements of
                                the project, I decided to build a comprehensive web service that would actually be useful for 
                                my peers. "Rethink Lakeside" is a website that allows students at my high school to rate and
                                review any class listed in the school's curriculum guide, and see what their peers think of any class
                                offered within the school. The website allows students to make better-informed decisions about 
                                what courses they will take, and it was utilized by many students before its MySQL
                                servers were reset. <strong>(The website features 100% custom CSS, and it was not built 
                                for mobile devices)</strong>

                            <p class="text-muted"> Other notable projects I've build include: 1) An iOS game I built in junior year.
                                It's essentially a reproduction of the popular mobile game Ballz, that uses custom built physics
                                and graphics. 2) A Virtual Reality horror game built in unity. I built this game as part of a
                                4-person team for a school project. The developement equipement is currently owned by my high
                                school, so I can't show it to you. 3) A 2d rocket simulator with custom, realistic physics.
                                The game was built in unity, and the game actually models the thrust created by the combustion
                                of a liquid fuel rocket down to changes in mass caused by fuel burn and torque caused by 
                                changes in thrust direction.

                                I hope to expand this list greatly, and show you all the better, newer things I create.

                                Earlier this year, a friend of mine named Roman Short sent me a picture. He manages
                                a Pagliacci Pizza branch in Bellevue, WA and the picture was of three large pizzas
                                that they were throwing away because of lower than expected demand.<br><br>
                                After conducting some research I quickly found that this was a widely experienced
                                problem that results in millions of pounds of wasted food by restaurants every year.
                                Additionally, I found that the existing solutions to this problem were generally
                                complex, logistically cumbersome, and expensive. There has to be a better way . . .

                                this service. To that end, I'd like to find partner who can help me with outreach, marketing
                                and implementation. Hopefuly, this app will make a differnce in the fight against restaurant
